# Comment Reel

## About Comment Reel
This is my fist official React on Rails stack application! Comment Reel is a movie conversation app, where users view other user's comments about certain movies already on the database. Can't find a particular movie? As soon as you login/signup, the user can add virtually any movie to the database so they can start their own conversation about that particular movie! Currently, this application is using the OMDB external API. Later on down the road, I plan on implementing the Twitter Search API and IMB Watson Tone Analyzer to further add value to the user experience!
